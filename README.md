# Sequence $P(n)_{cube}$
The sequence $(a_1, . . . , a_k)$, for which the Diophantine equation $$a^3_1+ · · · + a^3_k= (a_1 + · · · + a_k)^2 = n^2$$ holds is also a partition of $n = a_1 + · · · + a_k$. \
So we look at this equation from a different perspective. Instead of counting the number of sets with length n for which the equationholds, we count the number of sets whose sum is equal to n and for which $a^3_1 +· · ·+a^3_k= n^2$. We denote this number by $P(n)_{cube}$. Using the parallel implementation, we calculate $P(n)_{cube}$ for $n = 1, . . . , 220$. The computations took less than 12 hours using the parallel implementation with subsets on the same system. The values of P(n)cube also form an integer sequence. The computational results show that for $8 < n ≤ 200 and n ≡ 2 (mod 3)$ there are no partitions for which the equation holds. The sequence
