# Sequence $P(n)_{cube}$
The sequence $(a_1, . . . , a_k)$, for which the Diophantine equation \
\
$a^3_1+ · · · + a^3_k= (a_1 + · · · + a_k)^2 = n^2$\
\
holds is also a partition of $n = a_1 + · · · + a_k$. \
\
So we look at this equation from a different perspective. Instead of counting the number of sets with length $n$ for which the equation holds, we count the number of sets whose sum is equal to n and for which $a^3_1 +· · ·+a^3_k= n^2$. We denote this number by $P(n)_{cube}$. Using the parallel implementation, we calculate $P(n)_{cube}$ for $n = 1, . . . , 200$.
